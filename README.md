# react-twitter
### This project was made to:
  1) familiarize myself with React and play around
  2) learn how to deploy React onto Github Pages
  3) learn how to use Git in the terminal
  
### Things that this project can do:
  1) each time a user clicks on the button, the text will change its color
  2) each time a user clicks on the button, the counter will increase by 1
  3) for all elements inside a database, it can automatically create a "tweet" showing the name, tweet and the number of likes
  
By writing this all using React and converting it into a condensed form, the final result should show as 100% HTML
